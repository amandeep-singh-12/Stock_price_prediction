Long-Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network belongs to the family of deep learning algorithms. It is a recurrent network because of the feedback connections in its architecture. It has an advantage over traditional neural networks due to its capability to process the entire sequence of data. Its architecture comprises the cell, input gate, output gate and forget gate.
